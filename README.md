An app for couples for storing and celebrating memories, sharing wishes, sending
nudges and much more.

It is made to be self-hosted, so that you can keep your data safe and under your
control. The backend can run on any PHP enabled server and the mobile app
supports Android 6 or newer. iOS is currently unsupported, but might come later
when Compose Multiplatform matures.

_**Why flamingo?** Because flamingos form life-long relationships_

## Features

ðŸ“† **Memories** - keep track of your memories and show your relationship timeline.

ðŸŽ¶ **Music** - record songs for each other and listen to them in the app.

âœ¨ **Wishlist** - keep track of gift ideas and wishes.

ðŸ’” **Missing You** - send a nudge to your loved once to tell them that you're
missing them.

ðŸ§­ **Location** - help each other find you and keep your significant other safe
when they are alone. Privacy controls included.

## Getting the app

**Version 3.0** is in the works. I want to build privacy mechanisms into the app
(like end-to-end encryption of some data) and finish the multi-user support
features. When all of that is done, the app will release on the Play Store and
you'll be able to install the app and setup an account from there.

**Version 2.0** is what is currently available in the repo. Some multi-user
features have been merged, but there are no privacy protections built in yet.
The app is not available in any store for download. If you want to use this
version of the app, you can host it yourself. If you wish to do that, please
follow the instructions in [HOSTING.md](./HOSTING.md). Be aware, that there
might be breaking changes to both the backend (endpoints, database) and
frontend. Not all of them will be documented in an easy to follow way.

**Version 1.0** was never released to the public, but was a fully serverless
app. Due to that, it had some serious security issues (like bundling a private
key in the app for sending Firebase messages directly from the app).

## Architecture

The mobile app is built in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and uses Koin for
dependency injection.

Firebase Auth and Sign in with Google are used for authentication as I don't
feel confident building my own solution, but I'm sure that I can keep everything
safe with a little help from those. I know it's not ideal, but I want to keep
that part simple. Firebase tokens are used to verify the users identity on the
server and are sent with every request in the `Authorization` header.

Memory notifications are sent through a notification that is triggered by
a Firebase Functions daily job. In the past I used Android's `Alarm manager`,
but it was unreliable and often failed on some brands of phones that managed
background processes to aggressively. I've found that sending a Firebase
notifications reliably wakes up the app and allows it to do it's job. The
Firebase Functions task itself doesn't have any memories related logic, it
doesn't check if there are any memories for the day and it doesn't communicate
with the server. It's only job is to wake up the app so it can do it's thing.
