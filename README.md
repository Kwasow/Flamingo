An app for couples for storing and celebrating memories, sharing wishes, sending
nudges and much more.

It is made to be self-hosted, so that you can keep your data safe and under your
control. The backend can run on any PHP enabled server and the mobile app
supports Android 6 or newer. iOS is currently unsupported, but might come later
when Compose Multiplatform matures.
